0.1: make it play:
death - when an enemy reaches the princess
start menu: start game, quit game
death menu: show score, go to title screen
--done

0.2:
change to GL.RAW
display animations again
display textures
display text
--done

0.3:
add a menu system between New game and play-mode: choose level to play. Can reuse current menu ofc
make gameplay with a box for enemy / treasure

tasks
make enemy walk towards an object, from far left side of screen
multiple hits may be needed, dmg = word length, damage puts the back.
display hp of enemy
basic GUI - press 1 to cast a slow on the enemy
when enemy is at far right, make player hp go down
still only 1 enemy at a time

ideas
harder and harder
power ups/skills: regen and slow
graphical objects (not primitives)
choose category
targeting
more skills
money and unlocks
