0.1: make it play:
death - when an enemy reaches the princess
start menu: start game, quit game
death menu: show score, go to title screen

0.2:
change to GL.RAW
display animations again
display textures
display text

0.3:
make enemy walk towards an object, from far left side of screen
multiple hits may be needed, dmg = word length
display hp of enemy
basic GUI - press 1 to cast a slow on the enemy
when enemy is at far right, make player hp go down
still only 1 enemy at a time

ideas:
harder and harder
power ups/skills: regen and slow
graphical objects (not primitives)
choose category
targeting
more skills
money and unlocks
